# Design Patterns ðŸš€

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
<br>They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*.
<br>They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are *architectural patterns*.
<br>Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language.
<br>Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
<br><br>
- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- **Behavioral patterns** are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Creational patterns

### 1. Factory Method

#### Solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#

### 2. Abstract Factory
#### Solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

#

### 3. Builder
#### Lets us construct complex objects step by step. <br> The pattern allows us to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

#

### 4. Prototype
#### Lets us copy existing objects without making our code dependent on their classes.

#

### 5. Singleton
#### Lets us ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
