# Design Patterns ðŸš€

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called *idioms*.
<br>They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are *architectural patterns*.
<br>Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language.
<br>Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
